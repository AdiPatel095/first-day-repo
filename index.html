            Hi this is a short HTML page i created to introduce myself.<br>
            I live in Charlotte, originally from India.<br>
            I have worked in food and beverage industry for the past 7 years and ready to make a change.<br>
            I have coded before on personal items and know the how to, so I am here to learn the workflow and things I missed as I would have not needed them when doing it on my own.<br>
